# NODESEC

## Grunt

##### Registered Tasks
Configure the grunt tasks in Gruntfile.js.

devApp - compiles the nodesec specific js into one file without uglifying it.

devLib - compiles all libraries (underscore, handlebars, etc.) into one file with uglifying it. It also runs the task cmp which compiles templates and adds them to the libs.js.

css    - compiles, minifies, and blesses all css files.
cmp    - compiles all handlebars files.

prodApp and prodLib do the same thing as devApp/devLib, but they also uglify the files. These have not been tested yet, so use at your own risk.

wth    - starts grunt-watch, but you must customize this to handle your tasks.

All file locations and variables available to grunt tasks are located in ./grunt.config.json.
